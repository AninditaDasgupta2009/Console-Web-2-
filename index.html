        <h1>My Console Vlog</h1>
    <h2>First I downloaded visual studio code. Then I installed live server. It's a better platform Than Brackets.
         For now I have only done console.</h2>
         <h3>A console screen is used to show a person in which line does he have error. Suppose, in a string you gave a variable 
             and after that you need the variable again, but when you wrote the variable did the full code and did a live test to see
         if it is working or not , you see the code is not working. You start seeing the full code and that's time consuming.
         but if you use console,you can find out the mistake quite easily. you need to right click on the live test screen, then a
         drop-down list will appear. AT the end of the list their will be inspect. click on it. Another rectangular screen will appear.
         On the top of the inspect screen, you will see console, click on it. Their will be all the codes you wrote, if you put your code 
         in console also. If ther's an error it will show in console. So this is how you can use console.</h3>

        console.log(max);
